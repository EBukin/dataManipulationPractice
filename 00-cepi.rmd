CEPII is a French research center in international economics which produces studies, research, databases and analyses on the world economy and its evolution. It was founded in 1978 and is part of the network coordinated by the Economic Policy Planning for the Prime Minister. It conducts researches using the databases, models, expertise and international cooperation. CEPII is organized around four research programs. The overview of the CEPII activities is here: [http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/cepii/cepii.asp](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/cepii/cepii.asp). On  one of the following links you may find more information about CEPII's [researches](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/recherche/programmes_scientifiques.asp), [publisations](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/publications/publicat.asp), [events](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/evenements/conf.asp) and [data](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele.asp).

CEPII gathers and  harmonizes data from different sources, produces indicators and statistical measures. Data and figures are available online as well as interactive panorama of 80 countries on [CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/).

1.  CHELEM - Comptes Harmonisés sur les Echanges et L’Economie Mondiale - the CHELEM database [International trade flows, balances of payments and world revenues], developed by the CEPII, has been recognized as one of the most useful tools to analyse global economic trends in a framework combining coherence, exhaustiveness and reliability.
