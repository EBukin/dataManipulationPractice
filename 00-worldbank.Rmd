## WITS

**Source**

World Integrated Trade Solution is located here: [http://wits.worldbank.org/](http://wits.worldbank.org/). However, this is the guest users interface with the access to simple summary data. If you need to access full capabilities of WITS database, you need to log-in [here](https://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/Restricted/Login.aspx) (see more details below). 

WITS database is a website, that uses trade and tariff data from various sources (UN Comtrade, WTO, World Bank) in order to provide users with the interface for generating own trade statistics and indicators. WITS application also provides tools to perform single and multi-market tariff cut simulations. Extensive description of the methodology, used by WITS is located here: [http://wits.worldbank.org/methodology.html](http://wits.worldbank.org/methodology.html).

WITS provides multiple ways to access trade, tariff and non-tariff data. It has the following main sections.

*  TradeStats: Summary trade, tariff, non-tariffs and development indicators;
*  Analytical Databases: Databases derived using official trade data sources;
*  Global Preferential Trade Access Database (GPTAD): Search across different preferential trade agreements.

For more information, see this introductory [overview video](http://wits.worldbank.org/videos/tradestatshome.html).

**How to access data**

WITS is a complex tool, however it has a very good set of [learning materials](http://wits.worldbank.org/training.html#). If you have time, you can take an [eLearning course](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/Training/player.html), otherwise, it is possible to follow [video tutorials from WITS](http://wits.worldbank.org/trainingVideos.aspx?lang=en).

**Registration and login**

In order to use full capabilities of the WITS database all users need to log-in. The log in page is located [here](https://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/Restricted/Login.aspx). You can access this page from the main [WITS website](http://wits.worldbank.org), by clicking first 'Register' in the top right corner `r knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/wits-login-button.PNG")`. Follow all registration instructions. People with the FAO email are allowed to register in WITS and use all available capacities of the database. After you have finished your registration, click 'log in' in the same top-right corner of the [WITS website](http://wits.worldbank.org), enter your email and password and you will log into the WITS database:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/wits-login-page.png")
```

**Other important informatoin**

When the user are logged into WITS, the website offer a greater range of documentation and metadata. In particular: 

*  WITS data availability report can be explored and generated [here](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/Support%20Materials/ComtradeCatalog.aspx?Page=DataCatalog), it is only possible after log in;

*  Reference tables for converting countries, commodities and classifications are [here](http://wits.worldbank.org/referencedata.html);

*  Detailed product nomenclature is [here](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/Support%20Materials/CMTNomenclatureandConcordancesList.aspx?Page=ProductNomenclatureandConcordances);

*  Comprehensive WITS guide is [here](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/WITSHELP/WITSHelp.htm);

*  WITS has a developed API interface for direct data access from a programming environment. More information is available [here](http://wits.worldbank.org/witsapiintro.aspx). Here is the [WITS-API USER GUIDE](http://wits.worldbank.org/data/public/WITSAPI_UserGuide.pdf).

### WITS Trade data 

There are two main types of trade data in WITS, (1) UN Comtrade up to 6 digits oh HS classification trade data and (2) UN Comtrade Tariff-line data. To access UN Comtrade data we only need to log in to WITS with our user name (email) and password. However, if we want to extract bulk Comtrade data, we may need to provide our Comtrade data access token (see more details below).

#### Advance query for trade data access

The main tool of generating user-defined trade data reports from the UN Comtrade data in WITS is in using the [`Home > Advanced Query > Trade Data (UN Comtrade)`](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/AdvanceQuery/RawTradeData/QueryDefinition.aspx?Page=RawTradeData). Here you can select any reporters, partners, commodities, periods, and classification systems in order to generate desirable table with the trade data.

**Important** to note. At this step our queries are limited to the maximum of 100 000 rows. In order to be able to download more than 100 000 rows, you either need to log in from the FAO network, or provide a UN Comtrade token to the WITS database by clicking "click here to activate" on the page [`Home > Advanced Query > Trade Data (UN Comtrade)`](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/AdvanceQuery/RawTradeData/QueryDefinition.aspx?Page=RawTradeData) and follow the instructions: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/wits-login-ct-token.png")
```

A comprehensive instruction on how to use advanced queries is provided in the WITS [tutorial video](http://wits.worldbank.org/videos/advanced-query.html).

**IMPORTANT about ommodity classfication** Selecting the commodity classification is always tricky, when you want to construct a consistent time series they covers multiple years (5 and more)? you may find that more modern HS classifications will not be available in the past. For tackle this problem you need to switch to the old HS classification, such as HS 2002 or even HS 1992. Be ready, that the coding system in the old HS classifications may differ significant. To overcome this problem, check the [WITS mapping tables](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/Support%20Materials/CMTNomenclatureandConcordancesList.aspx?Page=ProductNomenclatureandConcordances) or [tables of concordance](http://wits.worldbank.org/product_concordance.html). 

#### User defined groups of commodities and countries

Tutorial video Highlights both options for user defined grouping of data. The best description of how to create and use the user-defined country and commodity groups is described in the WITS e-learning [here](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/Training/player.html) in the sections 20 and 21. Please check them for the guided instructions.

The lists of standard - predefined commodities and country groups are here:  [http://wits.worldbank.org/referencedata.html](http://wits.worldbank.org/referencedata.html) in the sections `Products` and `Countries`.

#### Tariff-line and bulk Comtrade data

WITS offers a user friendly interface for accessing [Tariff-line data (link to the interface)](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/QuickQuery/Trade-ViewAndExportRawData/ViewAndExportRawData.aspx?Page=TradeViewAndExportRawData) and [bulk Comtrade data (link to the interface)](http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/AdvanceQuery/BulkExport/BulkExportQueryDefination.aspx?Page=BulkExport). Practically, this interface repeats the one available in the Comtrade. To learn more about how to use it, see:
